# munchkin

This is an unfinished project that I've worked on a bit where I'm trying to recreate the board game Munchkin,
a parody on fantasy RPGs. It is intended to be a PC game with multiplayer. What I've worked on here is
backend stuff about the functionality and object-oriented components of the game. Java is the first language I
learned really well so I wrote this in Java. However, I plan on transitioning to C# and the Unity Engine
just to make designing the game easier and more practical rather than having to build it from the ground up.

Here's a video explaining the game and the rules:
